        <h2> &#171; World War II & Attack on Titan &#187;

        <p class="body"> <span class="bold">Hajime Isayama is the writer and illustrator for the manga Attack on Titan (AoT).</span> A war is taking place in AoT with Marley fighting against the world. Much of the warfare used in AoT is similar to that of World War II (WWII). It is through the textual evidence collected that makes it reasonable to assume that Hajime Isayama directly took inspiration from the past events of WWII and adapted these cal moments into his own story; thus, Attack on Titan is a fictional piece of literature which is inspired by historical moments taken place during WWII. </p>
        <div class="block left"><img src="image-20160621-13002-13s5hr2.avif" alt="WWII"></div>
        <p class="body"> <span class="bold">The main setting for the story takes place on the Island of Paradis (Paradis). </span> In Paradis, there is a civilization of Eldian people. The civilization uses three circular fifty meter tall walls to surround all of their infrastructure as protection against Mindless Titans that have an innate desire to kill any human being. Wall Maria is the outermost wall with four outposts attached to it. In the city of Shiganshina, Bertholdt Hoover controls the Colossal Titan abilities and kicks down the outpost wall connected to Wall Maria allowing Mindless Titans to swarm and thousands of citizens inside; later, Reiner Braun controls the Armored Titan to break the first main wall, Wall Maria. The attack on the city of Shiganshina was a planned military attack by the country of Marley. The breach in the outpost of Shiganshina and Wall Maria forced hundreds of thousands of civilians to abandon their homes to seek refuge behind the Wall Rose, the middle wall. <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/bombing-of-hiroshima-and-nagasaki">Using the two Titans as an analogy for the two atomic bombs that were detonated on Japan, Haijame Isayama uses past events from World War II that affected his home country and recounts the horrific tragedies and relates them back into his story. “The explosion immediately killed 80,000 people; tens of thousands more would later die of radiation exposure … a second B-29 dropped another A-bomb on Nagaski, killing an estimated 40,000” </a>. There is great loss within the story of AoT when Haiame Isayma shows Eren Yeager losing his mother to one of the Titans. Eren sees his mother get taken away from him as a result of the effects of war. <a href="https://time.com/after-the-bomb/">In a testimonial, Kumiko Arakawa wrote this about the Nagasaki attack, “As I headed back home the next day, an acquaintance informed me that my parents were at an air raid shelter nearby. I headed over and found both of them suffering severe burns. They died, two days later” </a>. By direct comparison, I believe Isayama was inspired by this historical event in World War II, and he adapted the U.S. military&#39;s attack on Japan to coincide with Marley&#39;s military attack on Paradis through the use of excessive military assault.

        <p class="body"> <span class="bold">In the country of Marley, they used children to strengthen their military forces through the use of biological warfare and genetic mutations. </span> Annie Leonhart, Bertholdt Hoover, and Reiner Braun are three such children forced to join Marley&#39;s regime and fight for a cause they do not believe in. In World War II, Japan was heavily inspired to use children for their own military regimes. <a href="https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20190624/p2a/00m/0fe/014000c"> Shoken Yoza was one of many Japanese schoolchildren forced to serve in the Tekksetsu Kinnotai, known as the “Student Corps of Iron andt Blood for the Emperor''</a>. <a href="https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20190624/p2a/00m/0fe/014000c">There is a correlation between allowing children to join the military and poor mental health because Yoza, at 90 years old, still lives with guilt from feeling responsible for the death of his classmate Kinjo, “Among my classmates who were also ordered to submit military applications on behalf of younger students, some of them just told the authorities that no-one was home … Why couldn&#39;t I do the same thing?” </a>. In direct comparison within the story AoT, Reiner Braun is shown to slowly lose his sanity increasingly more as the story progresses. As a member of the Marley regime he has one goal, but joining the Paradis regime as a double-agent to gain intel at such a young age made him lose focus on his mission and he slowly started becoming friends with the cadets of the Paradis regime, and as the story progresses he is forced to betray his friends of Paradis, and he cannot keep his sanity with the guilt felt by his actions which costed hundreds of thousands of lives. Biological warfare is used within the story of AoT through the Titan abilities. Several times throughout the story, Zeke uses his Beast Titan form to kill hundreds of citizens on Paradis.<a href="https://unit731.org/"> In World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army&#39;s Unit 731 aimed to develop biological weapons and study the human body. “Many of the prisoners … were used in hideous vivisection … to determine the effect of frostbite on the human body” </a>. <a href="https://unit731.org/">These experiments done on humans were not where it ended; furthering the tragedy, Unit 731 deliberately infected an estimated 3,000 enemy soldiers with plague, anthrax, cholera, and other pathogens, as well as subjecting them to pressure chambers to see how much a person could take before their eyes popped out </a>. In AoT, the comparison of Eren Yeager used as Paradis&#39; guinea pig along with Zeke, Reiner, Annie, and Berdtholt used as Marley&#39;s, the similarities cannot go unnoticed with the characters&#39; actions being almost identical with the actions of the Imperial Japan Army&#39;s Unit 731 in World War II. </p>

        <p class="body"> <span class="bold">Marley&#39;s country has waged war against many other nations in the world in the story of AoT along with the entire race of Eldians. </span>Marley treats Eldians as less-than human. Marley forces all Eldians who live within their nation to live in internment camps. The reasoning behind why Eldians are placed into internment camps is because their Eldian ancestors committed murder on a massive scale against the Marlian people, and now the present day Eldians suffer as a result. <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/pearl-harbor">Japanese American citizens suffered a similar fate the Eldians faced after the attack on Pearl Harbor near Honolulu Hawaii where hundreds of Japanese fighter planes destroyed nearly 20 American naval vessels, 300 airplanes, and killed about 2,400 Americans</a>. <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/japanese-american-relocation#:~:text=Contents&text=Japanese%20internment%20camps%20were%20established,through%20his%20Executive%20Order%209066.">In reaction to the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established Japanese internment camps through his Executive Order 9066 </a>.<a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/japanese-american-relocation#:~:text=Contents&text=Japanese%20internment%20camps%20were%20established,through%20his%20Executive%20Order%209066."> For three years, the United States of America along with Canada and Mexico affected the lives of around 142,000 people with Japanese ancestry with the stated intention to prevent espionage</a>. <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/japanese-american-relocation#:~:text=Contents&text=Japanese%20internment%20camps%20were%20established,through%20his%20Executive%20Order%209066.">Murder was also tolerated during this time when the U.S. found a sentry innocent after murdering two Japanese elders, “In Lordsburg, New Mexico, … two Japanese Americans, Toshio Kobata and Hirota Isomura, were shot and killed by a sentry who claimed they were attempting to escape”</a>. <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/japanese-american-relocation#:~:text=Contents&text=Japanese%20internment%20camps%20were%20established,through%20his%20Executive%20Order%209066">Japanese American, Japanese Mexican, and Japanese Canadian citizens all suffered forcible removal from their homes and were sent away to internment camps; notably, violence broke out on August 4, 1942 when a riot started as a result of anger about insufficient rations and overcrowding </a>. The treatment of people with Japanese ancestry in the West following the attack of Pearl Harbor violated those citizens&#39; rights. The internment camps during the time of WWII and the internment camps of Marley in AoT share similar attributes: both ignore the violence within the camps, both subject the citizens to the camps neglecting their human rights, and both choose extreme violence such as murder to handle anyone behaving not to their liking. In AoT, an officer admits to killing the sister of Zeke Yeager as punishment for the two siblings stepping outside of the internment camp to watch a blimp fly into the sky, and previously mentioned, two elderly men were both killed for an assumed escape attempt.

        <p class="body"> <span class="bold">Eren Yeager is an Eldian who was born and raised on Paradis Island. </span> Through his biological warfare capabilities, he kills more than 90% of the world&#39;s population in the attempt to remove anyone who did not live on Paradis Island as a way to allow his nation to thrive in peace. <a href ="https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP3.HTM">During the time of WWII, the Japanese military regime invaded China in 1937 and it is estimated that during the war, they killed 3,000,000 to 10,000,000 people</a>. In AoT, Eren does not target a single country nor race and in similar results, neither did the Japanese Army. <a href="https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP3.HTM">Killing an estimated 6,000,000 Chinese along with Indonesians, Koreans, Filiopinos, and Indochinese, among others, the Japanese Army enacted their military force upon various countries </a>. <a href="http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/japan_1900_power.htm">During the time of WWII, Imperial Japan held extreme patriotic views towards their country. The Japanese people were prepared to make endless sacrifices in order to expand their land for resources they did not have in abundance, “It is sometimes difficult to comprehend the extreme sacrifices the Japanese made in the name of the emperor. This can perhaps best be viewed, however, as extreme patriotism — Japanese were taught to give their lives, if necessary, for their emperor” </a>. Similarly, Eren Yeager makes extreme sacrifices like breaking his own bones, cutting himself with knives on multiple occasions, and eventually causing his own death, all for his nation and his friends to benefit in the future from his actions. The ideology of giving up one&#39;s life for the belief that a better nation will  arise from it is shared between Imperial Japan in WWII and  AoT&#39;s main character Eren Yeager, and it is through this shared ideology that both Eren and Japan felt justified committing genocide or mass murder.

        <p class="body"> <span class="bold">Japan's history in WWII involves biological warfare against other humans along with the genocide of millions of people in neighboring Asian countries.</span> Eren killed 90% of the world population and Zeke used biological warfare to kill hundreds of Eldians. Japanese Americans suffered horrible lives during their time spent in internment camps by the hands of the United States. Marlian people forced Eldians to stay in internment camps similar to the ones in the U.S. Through the evidence collected, it is my belief that when comparing the total collected history of Japan during WWIIand many prominent key plot points in AoT, Haijaime Isayama was inspired by the history of WWII to write AoT.
